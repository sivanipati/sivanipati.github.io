# Example: How to Add New Content

This file demonstrates how easy it is to add new content to your portfolio using the new markdown-based approach.

## Adding a New Project

Simply add a new section like this:

### New Project Name
**Challenge:** Brief description of the problem you solved.

**Approach:**
- First bullet point about what you did
- Second bullet point about your methodology
- Third bullet point about tools/technologies used

**Results:** Quantifiable outcome with **bold numbers** for emphasis.

## Adding New Metrics

Use a table format for clean presentation:

| Metric | Achievement | Impact |
|--------|-------------|---------|
| **New Metric** | 85% improvement | What this means for the business |
| **Another Metric** | $2M saved | Cost savings or revenue impact |

## Adding New Sections

Just use standard markdown headers:

### New Section Title
Regular paragraph text with **bold emphasis** and [links](/some-page.html).

- Bullet points for lists
- Another bullet point
- And another one
